NBA-salary-predictor using python


We are all really big basketball fans. We all love watching and playing basketball, which is why we wanted our project to have something to do with the NBA (National Basketball Association). The objective of our project is to create a machine learning model which uses NBA player statistics from the 2021-2022 season to determine their salaries for that same season. In order to do so, we obtained two datasets, one with player statistics for the season, and the other with player salaries for the season. Since NBA players do earn very high salaries annually, instead of having our model predict the specific number for their salary, we will create brackets that each of their salaries may fall into, and then predict players' salary brackets using our model. First, we will need to clean and prep each of these datasets, and then we will be able to join them together. After that, we can determine which features will be used in our models, and will test different models on their ability to predict the salary bracket of a player accurately.

What we concluded:
